# 💡 C-Engine-009 — Automatic Car Headlight System 🚗🌙

Part of the **C-Engine Series**, where I combine automobile engineering logic with C programming to build real-world problem-solving tools.

## 🔥 About
This program simulates an automatic car headlight control system using basic conditional logic.  
It turns headlights ON or OFF based on light sensor input — similar to real automotive sensor-based lighting systems.

## 📐 Logic Used
- If light == 1 → Night → Headlight ON  
- Else → Day → Headlight OFF  

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Variables (`int`)
- `scanf()` user input
- `if–else` conditional statements
- Sensor-based decision logic

## 🧩 Example
**Input:**  
`1`

**Output:**  
`Headlight ON : Nightmode`
